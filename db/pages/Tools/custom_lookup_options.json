For example, you can upload a CSV file whose data can be used as options within a select-type custom field such as \nSelect One – Dropdown\n, \nSelect One - Radio Button\n, or \nLookup - Autocomplete Options\n.\nCustom lookups can be used to provide large selection sets for your users, such as item inventory codes, code dictionaries, or geographic lookups. You can also easily setup dynamic sub-filtering conditions across multiple fields. For example, you could set up parent and child fields for selecting the country, university, faculty, and courses where the available options for each subsequent field is dependent upon the value of a previous field. This new functionality is advantageous since you don't need any of the data to exist as records in your system (as with the current \nEnable Dynamic Content\n option within a custom field) and it will be easier to update the options by importing them rather than editing large amounts of text in the custom field \nEdit\n screen.\nThis article will show you how to import a custom lookup, update a lookup, and the various ways it can later be referenced and used on your instance. You will need to be a \nGlobal Administrator\n to access these settings.\nConfiguration - Essentials\nAs an example, let's upload a custom lookup CSV containing university and course information. A sample of \nUniversityCourseLookup.csv\n is included in the appendix at the end of this article.\nImporting a New Custom Lookup\n Navigate to \nGlobal Settings\n > \nCustom Lookup Options\n and click on the \nImport Custom Lookup Options\n button represented by an import icon.\n \n You will now access step 1 one of the \nCustom Lookup Options Import\n wizard. Upload a CSV containing your custom data. The first row of the CSV must include column headers. A sample of \nUniversityCourseLookup.csv\n is included in the appendix at the end of this article.\n Give your custom lookup a descriptive name under \nLookup Name\n that will help you remember what it is for. For our example, we will call our lookup \"UniversityCourseLookup\".\n Select one of the columns for the \nLookup Key\n. The lookup key is a non-unique identifier that is associated with \none or more\n rows in the table. In our example, our lookup key is the \"University ID\" because this number corresponds to the different universities in our dataset.\n The \nPrimary Key\n is optional. A primary key is a unique identifier that corresponds to a \nsingle\n row in our table. For our example, the primary key is \"Course ID\" because each row in the table has a uniquely different Course ID that distinguishes it from every other row. Click \nNext\n to continue.\n Check over the sample of the uploaded data to ensure it has been processed as intended. Toggle which columns you want to include in the final import. Click \nNext\n to proceed.\n The last step will let you review the final changes. Click \nNext\n to complete the import process.\nUpdating an Existing Custom Lookup\n To update an existing custom lookup, import the updated file and be sure to type out the exact name of the lookup you want to update in the \nLookup Name\n field. Specify the lookup key and any primary key needed. Click \nNext\n to continue.\n You will see a warning that notifies you that an existing lookup with the same name already exists. All existing rows with that lookup name will be deleted and re-imported with the new updated data. Click \nNext\n to continue and click \nYes\n on the alert pop-up.\n Click \nNext\n to finish the import.\nViewing Custom Lookup Data\nTo view the data of any custom lookup, navigate to \nGlobal Settings\n > \nCustom Lookup Options\n to see a list of imported lookups. Click the name of the lookup you want to see in more detail. This will allow you to see the uploaded data in a list view format organized by the \nLookup Key\n.\n \nA sample list view of an imported custom lookup.\nThe list of values under \nLookup Value\n form an attribute-value pair of column values for the specified row. To see this data in more detail, click the icon on the far left marked \nOpen\n on any row. Based on the expanded \nLookup Value\n data, we can see that this specific row contains the values for our table columns \"Course ID\", \"University\", and \"Course\". \n \nAttribute-value pairs in the \nLookup Value\n are stored in JSON format.\nConfiguration - Advanced\nSetting Up a Standalone Dropdown List\nThe easiest way to make use of your imported custom lookup options is to use a standalone dropdown list. We will use our university course lookup as an example.\n Create a custom field of type \nSelect One - Dropdown List\n.\n Toggle on \nEnable Dynamic Content\n You will now see a new toggle called \nUse Custom Lookup Options\n. Toggle this on.\n You will now see additional settings for the custom lookup. Under the \nLookup Name\n dropdown, select the custom lookup you want to reference. Under \nOption Text Identifier\n, type the name of the lookup column whose values you want to populate in the dropdown. In our example, we want to expose the available course names in the dropdown so we will type the name of the column that contains that information: \"Course\".\n \nConfiguration settings for a standalone dropdown using a custom lookup.\nSetting Up a Parent-Child Dropdown List\nCustom lookups can be incorporated into dynamic dropdown lists using the parent and child relationship between data. After uploading a CSV for your custom data, you can set up a series of parent and child dropdown lists that can further filter user options based on previous selections.\nConfiguring the Parent Dropdown\n Create a custom field of type \nSelect One - Dropdown List\n.\n In the \nPredefined Options\n field, map the various lookup keys of your custom lookup data to the options you want to surface in the dropdown. In our example, our lookup keys span a range of 100 to 600, with each 100 increment corresponding to a different university. Mapping the lookup keys in this way will allow the child dropdown we set up later to be filtered by the selected lookup key. For example, if the user selects \"Totally Totes College\" (with a lookup key mapped to 100), the corresponding child dropdown options will filter the custom lookup data by this lookup key and only return the courses available to that university.\n \nConfiguration for a parent dropdown list. Note the first item has been set to \"--Select One--\" to make it the default option.\nConfiguring the Child Dropdown\n Create a custom field of type \nSelect One - Dropdown List\n and set the \nParent Field\n to the parent dropdown list created above.\n Toggle on \nEnable Dynamic Content\n You will now see a new toggle called \nUse Custom Lookup Options\n. Toggle this on.\n You will now see additional settings for the custom lookup. Under the \nLookup Name\n dropdown, select the custom lookup you want to reference. Under \nOption Text Identifier\n, type the name of the lookup column whose values you want to populate in the dropdown. In our example, we want to expose the available course names in the dropdown so we will type the name of the column that contains that information: \"Course\".\n \nConfiguration settings for the child dropdown.\nEnd Result of Parent-Child Dropdown\nThe available options within the child dropdown will now change depending on the selections made in the parent dropdown. In our example, changing the university in the parent dropdown will change the available courses we can select in the child dropdown.\n \nSetting Up Successive Dropdown Lists\nIn the previous example, all the predefined options had to be hardcoded into to the custom field configuration settings. This could be a laborious process if the custom data needs regular updates or new entries. The process can be simplified by importing multiple lookups. The section will illustrate how to use successive dropdown lists and reference multiple custom lookups without having to hardcode predefined options.\nAs an example, we want to set up a chain of parent-child dropdowns for course registration. We want the user to first select from a list of available universities, then select from a list of available faculties at that selected university, and lastly, we want the user to select from a list of available courses under that university faculty.\nAll referenced CSV files are provided in the appendix below.\nConfiguring the Parent Dropdown\n Import \nUniversityLookup.csv\n with the \"University ID\" as the \nLookup Key\n and the \"Primary Key\" as the \nPrimary Key\n. Set \nLookup Name\n to \"UniversityLookup\".\n Create a custom field of type \nSelect One - Dropdown List\n and give it the caption \"University\".\n Toggle on \nEnable Dynamic Content\n and \nUse Custom Lookup Options\n.\n Under \nLookup Name\n, select \"University Lookup\". Under \nOption Text Identifier\n, type the name of the lookup column you want to surface. For our example, we type \"University\".\n \nConfiguration settings for the university dropdown.\nConfiguring the First Child Dropdown\n Import \nFacultyLookup.csv\n with the \"University ID\" as the \nLookup Key\n and the \"Faculty ID\" as the \nPrimary Key\n. Set \nLookup Name\n to \"FacultyLookup\".\n Create a custom field of type \nSelect One - Dropdown List\n and give it the caption \"Faculty\".\n Set the \nParent Field\n to previously created \"University\" dropdown custom field.\n Toggle on \nEnable Dynamic Content\n and \nUse Custom Lookup Options\n.\n Under \nLookup Name\n, select \"FacultyLookup\". Under \nOption Text Identifier\n, type the name of the lookup column you want to surface. For our example, we type \"Faculty\".\n \nConfiguration settings for the faculty dropdown.\nConfiguring the Second Child Dropdown\n Import \nUniversityCourseLookup.csv\n with the \"Faculty ID\" as the \nLookup Key\n and the \"Course ID\" as the \nPrimary Key\n. Set \nLookup Name\n to \"UniversityCourseLookup\".\n Create a custom field of type \nSelect One - Dropdown List\n and give it the caption \"Course\".\n Set the \nParent Field\n to previously created \"Faculty\" dropdown custom field.\n Toggle on \nEnable Dynamic Content\n and \nUse Custom Lookup Options\n.\n Under \nLookup Name\n, select \"UniversityCourseLookup\". Under \nOption Text Identifier\n, type the name of the lookup column you want to surface. For our example, we type \"Course\".\n \nConfiguration settings for the course dropdown.\nEnd Result of Successive Parent-Child Dropdowns\nThe available options within the child dropdown will now change depending on the selections made in the parent dropdown. In our example, changing the university in the parent dropdown will change the available faculty listings in the subsequent faculty dropdown. The user's selection in this faculty dropdown will then filter the available options in the course dropdown.\n \nSuccessive parent and child dropdowns.\nSettings Explained\nImport Settings\nOption\nDescription\nLookup Name\nThe Lookup Name is used to identify the set of lookup options. If you want to update an existing custom lookup, ensure the Lookup Name is the same as the existing custom lookup.\nLookup Key\nThe Lookup Key is a non-unique identifier used to return all rows with a matching Lookup Name.\nPrimary Key\n(Optional) The Primary Key is an optional unique key used to return a single row that matches the Lookup Name and Primary Key value. Rows without a matching Primary Key will be imported as new rows.\nConfiguration Settings\nOption\nDescription\nOption Text Identifier\nThe name of the column header from your custom dataset whose values you want to display in the dropdown.\nOption Value Identifier\n(Optional) The name of the column header from your custom dataset whose values are unique for each row. If a \nPrimary Key\n was defined when importing the custom lookup, you can leave this field blank.\nAppendix\nUniversityLookup.csv\nUniversity ID,Primary Key,University\n100,100,--- Please Select
