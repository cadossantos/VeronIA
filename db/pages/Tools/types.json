Then create the desired custom fields in the normal fashion.\n The \nDisplay Order\n of the \nCustom Fields\n you create on a Type works in conjunction with the \nDisplay Order\n on any general Level 2 or Level 3 \nCustom Fields\n that have been defined.\n \nFor example, if you have a Custom Field on a Level 2 Type with Display order of 15, it would appear between the global Level 2 custom fields with display orders of 10 and 20.\n \nNotes\nNotes\n can also be added to individual Types. This feature assists system administrators keep track of the functionality and changes to individual types.\nSee Also\n \nRestricting Level 2 Types to Specific Level 1 Templates\n \nTemplate / Type Formula\n \nList View\n  \nLevel 2 Types\n      \nRestricting Level 2 Types to Specific Level 1 Templates\n  \n \n Retrieved from ‘\nhttps://wiki.smartsimple.com/index.php?title=Types&oldid=39369\n’ \nCategory\n: \nUniversal Tracking Application",
