  "content": "From SmartWiki\n Jump to: \nnavigation\n, \nsearch\nKML\n stands for \nKeyhole Markup Language\n and is a file format used to display geographic data in Earth browsers such as Google Earth, Google Maps and Google Maps for Mobile. KML was developed for use with Google Earth, which was originally named Keyhole Earth Viewer. KML uses a tag-based structure with nested elements and attributes and is based on the \nXML\n standard. It contains boundary coordinates and placemark information for multiple zones.\nThere are three ways KML features can be used with SmartSimple.\n \nUpload a KML file to an XML field\n \nEnable KML on a custom field\n \nUse a System Variable to store a link to a public KML file\nUploading a KML File to an XML Field\n Create a \nSpecial - XML Data\n custom field.\n Set the \nEnable KML\n and \nShow Upload Button\n settings.\nThe field on a record will display an Upload button, from which you can select a downloaded file in *.kml format.\nOnce the *.kml file is opened, the field's \nOpen\n button will open a Google Map window with the KML overlay you have uploaded.\nEnabling KML on Custom Fields\nKML can be enabled on the following custom field types:\n \nDynamic Data – Dynamic Control Field\n \nLookup – Entity and People\n \nLookup – External Entity\n \nLookup – External People\n \nSelect Many – Check Boxes\n \nSelect Many – List Box\n \nSelect One – Combo Box\n \nText – Password Protected\n \nText – Multiple Lines\n \nText – Single Line\n \nLookup - NAIC Codes\n \nLookup - ICD Code\n \nSpecial - XML Data\nTo do so, edit the custom field and, under General Options, select the \"Enable KML\" option:\nFields that contain \nSmartSimple KML Variables\n will display as a \"View Map\" button in \nview mode\n:\n \nField in Edit Mode\nField in View Mode\nIn this case, California will be highlighted on the Google Map, and census information will be available.\nSmartSimple KML Variables\n currently supported are:\n @geo.us.states, for U.S. States\n @geo.us.counties, for U.S. counties and \n @geo.ca.provinces, for Canadian provinces.\nSmartSimple KML Variable Syntax\nTo highlight only two U.S. counties\n@geo.us.counties.Washington-Ferry@,@geo.us.counties.North Dakota-Renville@\nor\n@geo.us.counties.Washington-Ferry,North Dakota-Renville@\n(both return the same map overlays)\nTo only show Washington State\n@geo.us.states.washington@\nTo show all U.S. counties\n@geo.us.counties.*@\nTo show all Canadian provinces\n@geo.ca.provinces.*@\nStoring Public KML Files to System Variables\nYou can add public *.kml and *.kmz files as \"System Map Overlays\" to every map generated by a KML-enabled field:\nCreate a \nSystem Variable\n whose \nName\n begins with the characters \"KML-\" \nThe System Variable \nValue\n will be the URL leading to the KML file on the Internet.\nAll such System Variables will be displayed as selectable overlays on the left-hand side of Google Maps opened with KML-enabled custom fields.\nThe label of the selectable overlay will the characters in the System Variable \nName\n to the right of the \"KML-\" characters. So a System Variable named \"KML-Bicycle Shelters\" will be labeled \"Bicycle Shelters\" on the Google Map.\nSee \nSystem Variables\n page for additional information.\n \n Retrieved from ‘\nhttps://wiki.smartsimple.com/index.php?title=KML&oldid=28261\n’ \nCategories\n: \nGlossary\nGeocoding\nXML",
