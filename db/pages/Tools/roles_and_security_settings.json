User Roles group similar people together and are additive; this means that a user may possess multiple roles, so roles need not be mutually exclusive. Typically, we will group users on what they will be doing within \nSmartSimple\n - for example, \nReviewers, Grant Approvers \n- and by their department - for example, \nHuman Resources \nor \nAccounting. \nA \nuser\n's \nrole\n is there fundamental to their \nRole Base Access Control (RBAC), \nwhich comprises what we can apply the umbrella term of \nRole-Based Security.\nAdvantages of Role-Based Security\n You can make individuals, regardless of their \norganization\n, members of a role and therefore provide them access to a specific resource.\n When you move the user to another organization, it does not affect their permission to access a resource.\n Associating the role with the resource is less time-consuming than if the alternative is to associate the resource to many organizations. \nThis security scheme should be used when the relationships between users and system resources are more complex, and you need to provide access to resources independent of any organizational structure. \nThe \nRoles and Security Settings \npart of the SmartSimple system will allow you to configure the \nRole-Based Security \nscheme to your personal needs.\nCombining Organization and Role-Based Security\nYou are also able to combine \norganization-based security\n with role-based security; both work through the same process of permissioning certain roles and/or organizations within the system to have differing levels of accessibility, functionality, and visibility of features. \nFor example, if you wish to share a \ncalendar\n with everyone in a \nMarketing Department, \nyou could share that calendar with both a specific organization \nand \nanyone with a \nSales \nrole. You would therefore use organization-based security to permission anyone in that marketing department with access, but you would use role-based security to permission individual users in the \nSales \nrole.\nConfiguration - Essentials\nPrior to configuring \nRole-Based Security, \nyou must have first configured \nroles\n into your system. If you have not yet done this in your system, or do not yet know how to, please read our article on \nHow to Create a User Role\n. \nAccessing Roles and Security Settings\nThe \nRoles and Security Settings\n of your \nSmartSimple\n \ninstance\n can be accessed through the following steps:\n1. Click the 9-square menu icon on the top right of your page.\n \n2. Under the heading \nConfiguration,\n select \nRoles and Security Settings\n.\n \nThe \nRoles and Security\n Settings page will be displayed.\n \nFunctions of Roles and Security Settings\nThe \nRoles and Security Settings\n page allows access to the following configuration pages within SmartSimple:\nRoles and Categories\nUser Roles\n \n- Use roles in order to control the \nmenu\n, \nportal\n, \nreports\n, and fields associated with a specific group of \nusers\n or \ncontacts\n. Roles also control field \nvisibility\n and the types of contacts that a user in a specific role is able to add into the system. It is under this tab that you are also able to edit the \nCommon Portal\n, the aggregated portal that can be helpfully applied to users in all roles rather than a specific role.\nOrganization Categories\n \n- Use this feature in order to create categories for companies, control \nvisibility\n to companies in a specific category, and define the \nCustom Fields\n for each category.\nSystem Security Settings\nGlobal Security Settings\n - \nManage business and system security settings, including \nPassword Policy\n and \nEmail & Email Broadcast Security\n. \nSystem Feature Permissions\n - Allows for \nSystem Administrators\n to personalize their copy of \nSmartSimple\n, making various system objects available to users in different roles. The \nFeature \npermissions will allow you to modify the accessibility of certain system features, such as \nNotes\n, \nReports\n, \nSmartFolders\n, and more. \nSystem Visibility Permissions\n - Allows for System Administrators to personalize their copy of SmartSimple, making various system objects available to users in different roles. In the \nVisibility \npermissions, you can \nlimit View Access \nand\n hide \ncertain features.\n \nNote: \nIt is recommended to use the \nOrganization and User Security Matrix\n over the system visibility permissions for higher levels of security; the matrixes can be accessed from \nGlobal Settings\n > Security. \nLegacy Application Permissions\n - \nDetermine which roles are associated with base application functions - for example, \nApplicant Tracking\n and \nWeb Forms\n. \n-based Settings\nUTA Security\n \nSettings - \nPermission the security settings of the specific \nUTA\n here. Features of security include a \nSecurity Matrix\n and role restrictions. \nUTA Visibility Settings - \nDetermine the visibility permissions for various objects and level of control for the specific \nUTA\n. \n \nNote: \nEach separate \nUTA\n in your SmartSimple system will have its own heading of these settings, so that you can permission their security and visibility settings differently depending on the application and depending on which roles should appropriately have access to which UTA. \nSee Also\n \nCategory:Security\n \nCategory:Roles\n \nCompany and User Security Matrix\n \nUser Role\n \nOverview of the Security Models\n \nRole Based Security\n \nUTA Settings - Security\n \nSystem Security Summary\n \n Retrieved from ‘\nhttps://wiki.smartsimple.com/index.php?title=Roles_and_Security_Settings&oldid=38985#Overview\n’ \nCategories\n: \nSystem Management\nSecurity\nRoles",
