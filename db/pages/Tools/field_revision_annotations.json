By using field-level annotations, users can modify particular fields and respond to comments without altering the rest of the record. This article will guide you through utilizing and configuring the annotation collaboration feature as part of an application review process. \nNote:\n You must be a \nGlobal Administrator\n to configure this feature. \n The interface and recommended configuration practices for the annotations feature have been updated as part of the July 2024 upgrade.\n You can only edit the values of a single field at a time using the annotations feature. Validation will only run on the field being modified. Therefore, if you are using dynamic field visibility controls or need to run full validation on the entire form, you may need to exit annotation mode and go to an unlocked status to achieve this.\nHow Annotations Work\nLet's walk through how the annotation feature can be configured as part of an application process involving an applicant, a program manager, and a reviewer.\n1. Applicant Submits Application\nThe applicant enters the required information into a form and submits it.\n2. Program Manager Assigns a Reviewer\nThe program manager assigns a reviewer to the application and advances the application to the next stage.\n3. Reviewer Conducts Initial Review and Creates Annotations\nThe reviewer is notified of their assignment to review the application.\nIn this scenario, the application is not yet ready to be approved or rejected, prompting the reviewer to make field-level suggestions (annotations) for changes or clarifications.\nThe reviewer hovers over and left-clicks the desired field to open a new annotation window. Here, they enter a message asking the applicant to change or clarify something related to this field, and then the reviewer saves the annotation.\n \nLeft-click the desired field to create a new annotation. Enter the relevant content into the \nMessage\n field and click \nSave\n.\nThis process is repeated for all fields requiring changes or clarifications.\nOnce all annotations are added, the reviewer clicks the annotation submission button to send the record back to the applicant.\n \nAnnotations will appear in the right-hand panel. Click the annotation submission button to send the record back to the applicant.\n4. Applicant Reviews Annotations, Modifies Values, and Adds Clarifications\nThe applicant is notified that action is required on their application.\nThe applicant navigates to their application, which opens in \nAnnotation Mode\n.\nIn \nAnnotation Mode\n, fields without annotations are locked. The applicant sees a list of annotations in the right panel and can click on any annotation to engage in a specific field-level discussion.\n \nA list of annotations appears in a right-hand panel.\nWhen focused on an annotation, the applicant can click the \nReply\n button to open a modal window, where they can modify the field value and add a clarifying message.\n \nClick on a specific annotation thread to expand it. Click the \nReply\n button to respond to the annotation.\nAnnotations from other users (such as the reviewer) are highlighted in yellow, indicating they may require a response, while annotations you create (as an applicant) are highlighted in blue.\n \nYour own annotations appear in blue while annotations made by other users appear in yellow.\nAfter responding and modifying field values, the applicant clicks the annotation submission button to move the status forward, triggering a workflow that notifies the reviewer of the changes made.\n5. Reviewer Conducts a Subsequent Review and Marks Annotations as Resolved\nThe reviewer is notified that action is required and navigates to the application.\nThe reviewer evaluates the changes and the applicant's replies. If no further changes or clarifications are needed, the reviewer marks each field-level annotation as resolved.\n \nClick the \nMark as Resolved\n button to close an annotation thread.\nResolved annotations are indicated with a green check mark, showing no further action is required.\n \nResolved annotations appear at the bottom of the annotation list with green coloring and a checkmark.\nIf all outstanding changes are addressed, the reviewer advances the application using the annotation submission button.\n6. Exiting Annotation Mode\nUsers can exit \nAnnotation Mode\n by clicking the close icon (“X”) in the gray box. This may be necessary to access the left navigation or other record-related elements not visible in \nAnnotation Mode\n.\nNote\n:\n Fields found under the \"More\" tab of the left navigation do not support annotations.\n \nClick the close icon to exit \nAnnotation Mode\n.\nTo re-enter \nAnnotation Mode\n, click the \nAnnotation Mode\n toggle located in the high visibility area at the top right of the record.\n \nTo re-enter or toggle on Annotation Mode, click the icon in the high visibility bar.\nConfiguration\nBelow is an explanation of how a \nGlobal Administrator\n could configure the annotations feature to work as described in the scenario above.\nUser Roles\nYou will need two roles: a role for the applicant and a role for the person doing the reviewing. Depending on your business process, you may already have two roles you can use or you may wish to create two new roles. If you are creating new roles, you may create these as system or UTA (association) roles depending upon your business process. To create new roles, navigate to the \nMenu Icon\n > \nRoles and Security\n > \nUser Roles\n > Click the \nNew Role\n button (represented by a plus sign). Typically roles created would be called “Applicant” and “Reviewer” or “Internal Staff”.\nAnnotation Types\nAnnotation types determine who can make annotations and when. Usually, there are two annotation types: one for the applicant and another for an internal staff member or designated reviewer.\nCreating a \"Reviewer\" Annotation Type\n Navigate to \nMenu Icon\n > \nGlobal Settings\n > \nSystem\n tab > \nAnnotation Types\n.\n Click the \nNew Type\n button (represented by a plus sign).\n Create an annotation type with the name and caption of either “Reviewer Annotation” or “Staff Annotation” depending on your process and preferred terminology.\n Enter a description that states the purpose of this annotation type. For example, you could enter “Used to create field-level annotations by reviewers requesting changes from the applicant”.\n Navigate to the \nPermissions & Availability\n tab.\n For the \nAllow View\n field, select both the applicant and reviewer roles. This way both applicants and reviewers will be able to see both types of annotations on a record.\n For the \nAllow Create\n field, only select the reviewer role so only a reviewer can create the \"Reviewer\" type of annotation.\nCreate an \"Applicant\" Annotation Type\n Navigate to \nMenu Icon\n > \nGlobal Settings\n > \nSystem\n tab > \nAnnotation Types\n.\n Click the \nNew Type\n button (looks like a plus sign).\n Create a type with the name and caption of “Applicant Annotation”.\n Enter a description the states the purpose of this annotation type. For example, you could enter “Used to create field-level annotations by the applicant, responding to change requests from a reviewer”.\n Navigate to the \nPermissions & Availability\n tab.\n For the \nAllow View\n field, select both the applicant and reviewer roles. This way both applicants and reviewers will be able to see both types of annotations on a record.\n For the \nAllow Create\n field, select just the applicant role. So only an applicant can create the applicant type of annotation.\nSetting up Statuses for Annotations\nStatus are used to control what happens at different stages of a process such as bringing the user directly into annotation mode and notifying a user that they need to change values on their application. To achieve the above scenario, we are using many statuses within our desired universal tracking application.\nStatuses are created by going to the desired \nUniversal Tracking Application\n > \nConfiguration Settings\n > Select the desired tab (such as “Level 1 Grant”) > \nStatuses\n > Click the \nNew Status\n button (represented by a plus sign). Enter the desired information and define the availability, permissions, and then click \nSave\n.\nBelow is an explanation of each status and how it was configured:\nName\nDescription\nConfiguration Steps\nDraft\nThe grant application is being filled in by the applicant.\n Toggle on \nIs Default Status\n Toggle on\n Is Default Copy Status\n Go to the\n Permissions & Availability\n tab and under the “Availability” section, select the relevant grant types for the \nEnable on Grant Types\n field.\nSubmitted\nThe applicant has submitted the application and can no longer edit it.\n Toggle on \nLock On Status\n Go to the \nPermissions & Availability\n tab and under the “Role Permissions” section, select the “Program Manager” user role for the \nOverride Lock\n field so they can move the record forward after assigning a reviewer.\n Go to the \nPermissions & Availability\n tab and under the “Availability” section, select the relevant grant types for the \nEnable on Grant Types\n field.\nReviewer Assigned and Notified\nThe reviewer has been notified that the application is ready for review.\n Toggle on \nLock On Status\n Go to the \nPermissions & Availability\n tab and under the “Role Permissions” section, select the “Program Manager” user role for the \nOverride Lock\n field so they can move the record forward \n Go to the \nPermissions & Availability\n tab and under the “Availability” section, select the relevant grant types for the \nEnable on Grant Types\n field.\n Set up a Level 1 workflow to send an email notification to the reviewer by going to \nMenu Icon\n > \nWorkflows\n > Create a new workflow > Set \nWorkflow Object\n to this UTA and set \nTrigger On\n to this status.\nReviewer Annotation and Creation\nThe reviewer adds annotations to the grant application, requesting changes and clarifications. They also review the applicant's annotations.\n Toggle on \nLock On Status\n Go to the \nPermissions & Availability\n tab and under the “Annotation System Role Permissions” section, select the “Applicant” user role for the \nView\n field, select the “Reviewer” user role for the \nView and Create\n field, select the \"Reviewer\" user role for the \nMark as Resolved\n field, and select both “Applicant” and “Reviewer” user roles for the \nOpen in Annotation Mode\n field.\n Go to the \nPermissions & Availability\n tab and under the “Availability” section, select the relevant grant types for the \nEnable on Grant Types\n field.\nRevisions Requested\nThe applicant is notified. They must change values, reply to annotations, and provide clarity to issues raised.\n Toggle on \nLock On Status\n Go to the \nPermissions & Availability\n tab and under the “Annotation System Role Permissions” section, select the “Applicant” user role for the \nView\n field as well as the \nEdit Field\n input, select the “Reviewer” user role for the \nView and Create\n field, and select both “Applicant” and “Reviewer” user roles for the \nOpen in Annotation Mode\n field.\n Go to the \nPermissions & Availability\n tab and under the “Availability” section, select the relevant grant types for the \nEnable on Grant Types\n field.\n Set up a Level 1 workflow to send an email notification to the applicant by going to \nMenu Icon\n > \nWorkflows\n > Create a new workflow > Set \nWorkflow Object\n to this UTA and set \nTrigger On\n to this status.\nApplicant Revisions Submitted\nThe reviewer is notified that the applicant has made the requested changes and provided clarity.\n Toggle on \nLock On Status\n Go to the \nPermissions & Availability\n tab and under the “Annotation System Role Permissions” section, select the “Applicant” and “Reviewer” user roles for the \nView\n field, select the “Reviewer” user role for the \nView and Create\n field, and select both “Applicant” and “Reviewer” user roles for the \nOpen in Annotation Mode\n field.\n Go to the \nPermissions & Availability\n tab and under the “Availability” section, select the relevant grant types for the \nEnable on Grant Types\n field. \nSet up a Level 1 workflow to send an email notification to the reviewer by going to \nMenu Icon\n > \nWorkflows\n > Create a new workflow > Set \nWorkflow Object\n to this UTA and set \nTrigger On\n to this status.\nApproved\nThe grant application has been approved.\n Toggle on \nLock On Status\n Go to the\n Permissions & Availability\n tab and under the “Availability” section, select the relevant grant types for the \nEnable on Grant Types\n field.\nDeclined\nThe grant application has been declined.\n Toggle on \nLock On Status\n Go to the \nPermissions & Availability\n tab and under the “Availability” section, select the relevant grant types for the \nEnable on Grant Types\n field.\nStatus Settings Explained\nThese settings are found at \nUTA\n > \nConfiguration Settings\n > \nLevel 1\n tab > \nStatuses\n > Select a \nStatus\n. \nLock On Status\nPrevents users from editing the application record and hides any \nSave and Submit Buttons\n configured to appear on this status.\nOverride Lock\nAllows a user role to edit a locked record and see the submit and save buttons configured to appear at this status.\nAvailability\nControls which types of applications will have access to this status\nAnnotation System Role and Annotation Association Role Permissions\nDepending on the business requirements you may choose to use Annotation System Roles (Example: anyone with the system reviewer role has permissions) or Annotation Association Role Permissions (Example: anyone attached to the record as a contact in the UTA role of reviewer has permissions).\nView\nWho can see the annotations\nView and Create\nWho can create new annotation threads and reply to existing annotations\nEdit Field\nWho can edit the value of the field being annotated and reply to existing annotation threads\nMark as Resolved\nControls who can see the \"Mark as Resolved\" and \"Mark as Unresolved\" buttons. These buttons are typically accessible to users assigned to the role of reviewing the application.\nOpen in Annotation Mode\nWho can see the record in annotation mode by default\nAnonymize Creator\nHides the name of the person who added the annotation\nWorkflow Notifications\nAt multiple stages in the process notifications will automatically be sent to the reviewer and applicant letting them know that action is required on an application.\nTo accomplish this a workflow is set up by navigating to \nMenu Icon\n > \nWorkflows\n.\n Click the “New Workflow” button (looks like a plus sign).\n Select the desired UTA for the \nWorkflow Object\n field.\n Select the desired Level 1 status for the \nTrigger On\n field. Then click \nSave\n.\n Setup a task with the \nTask Type\n of “Acknowledgement” and choose the message type of “Email”.\n In the email message, you may wish to include both the name of the application and a link to the application.\nSubmit Buttons and Annotation Submission Buttons\nSubmit buttons move a record between statuses that are not locked. A user role can also be given permission to override a locked status to see submit buttons.\nAnnotation submission buttons are intended for use only in \nAnnotation Mode\n when the record is locked where other submit and save buttons are hidden.\nBoth types of submission buttons are configured by navigating to the desired \nUTA\n > \nConfiguration Settings\n > Click on the desired \nLevel 1\n, \n2\n, or \n3\n tab > \nSubmit and Save Buttons\n.\nWe created the following submit buttons for our scenario:\nName\nDescription\nType\nConfiguration Steps\nSubmit\nApplicant submits and this locks the application to the applicant.\nSubmit\n Select “Draft” under the \nAvailable to Status\n field.\n Select “Submitted” under the\n Submit to Status\n field.\n Toggle on \nEnable Confirmation Alert Message\n.
