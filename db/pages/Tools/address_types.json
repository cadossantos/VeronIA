If you are in the \nSystem Administrator\n role, you will also have the ability to modify the Address Type from the profile by editing the existing address or adding new addresses. \nAccessing Address Types\nIn order to use this feature, follow these steps: \n1. Click on the 9-square menu icon on the top right of your page. \n \n \n2. Under the heading \nConfiguration, \nselect \nGlobal Settings.\n3. Under the first tab, select \nAddress Types. \n \n \nThe list of available Address Types will be displayed. If there are none in the system, this page will be blank.

You can edit existing Address Types by selecting the \npencil \nicon on the left of each Type name. \nManually Creating a New Address Type\nTo create a new Address Type manually, after clicking the \n+ \nicon from the \nAddress Types \npage, you must fill in the fields for the new type. \n \n \nName\nText used to identify an address type\nCaption\nNormally the same as \nName, \nunless you want to add a label for the address type that is different\nDisplay Order\nAddress types will be displayed in the drop-down with regards to the \ndisplay order\n, with the lowest value of display order appearing first in the drop-down list.\nDescription \nA general description for the address type\nColour Code\nAn optional colour code for the address type when displayed\nDefault Type\nIn order to use the \nMultiple Addresses \nfeature, a default address must be selected.\n \nAs Default Type for Users - \nSelect this option to make this Address Type the default type for user records. \n \nAs Default Type for Companies - \nSelect this option to make this Address Type the default type for organization records.\nNote: \nEnabling either of these will make \nall \nroles (for Users) and \nall \ncategories (for Companies) have access to this Address Type. \nMaximum Number of Addresses\nThe maximum quantity of this specific type of address allowed. \n If a Default Type is not set on an Address Type - either for Users or Companies - the combo box for Address Types will not be displayed when adding/editing an address record. \nClick \nSave \nonce you are done filling out the fields, and click onto the second tab, \nPermissions and Availability.\n \nClick into each text box to select which statuses, roles, and categories will have access to this Address Type from within their user or company \nprofile\n. Depending on whether you have enabled the Address Type as a default for Users or Categories, you will not have the option to select specific roles or categories - instead, the default function makes this Address Type available to all.\nOnce the fields are populated as required, click \nSave.\nThe details of the new \nAddress Type \nwill display on a new page,  indicating that it is now available on the list of Address Types available in your \nSmartSimple\n \ninstance\n.\nOn the left hand side, the menu items related to Address Types will be displayed: \n \n \nMain\nThe \nGeneral \ntab displays the descriptive information related to the Address Type: \n Address Type ID \n Name\n Caption\n \nDisplay order\n Description \n Default Type options \n Maximum Number of Addresses\nThe second \nPermissions & Availability \ntab denotes the roles, statuses, and categories able to access this Address Type. \nNotes\nYou can create, edit and view \nnotes\n attached to this Address Type.\nAddress Template\nYou can create, edit and view the \naddress template\n associated with this Address Type. The address template is a feature used to personalize the block of text that is returned when using the @addressbobok@ \nvariable\n. See the \nAddress Book Template\n page for configuration instructions. \nStandard Fields\nLearn how to add Standard Fields to Address Type.\nCustom Fields\nLearn how to add Custom Fields to Address Type. \nImporting Address Types\nOn the main \nAddress Types \npage, you have the options to either \nimport \nnew records as Address Types into the system, or \nexport \nthe existing Address Types. \n \n The \nimport \noption is on the left; the \nexport \nbutton is on the right. \nExporting Address Types\nIn order to use this feature, you must first go to \nGlobal Settings\n > \nSystem\n and check off the \"Enable Multiple Address\" option.\n \nIMPORTANT:\n when enabling you \nmust\n follow the instructions on the \nImporting Address\n Wiki article to ensure the existing addresses are retained. If the \nEnable Multiple Address\n option is turned on without importing addresses from existing profiles or loading a new set of addresses, whenever a new address is added to a profile, the original data stored in the profile address will be lost\nConfiguration - Advanced\nAdd Custom Fields to Address Type\nAfter clicking into the specific Address Type you want to configure, go to the left-hand menu and select \nCustom Fields.\nOnce the custom fields page is open, click the \n+ \nicon on the top right above the Custom Fields list to create a new Custom Field.\n \n \nThe New Custom Field window is displayed, with existing options for configuring required custom fields. \n \n \nSee \nCustom Fields - General Information\n for further details about configuring custom fields.\nAdd Standard Fields to Address Type\nOn the Address Type list page, click on the \npencil icon \nto the left of the Address Type you want to add and configure Standard Fields to. \n \nOn the left hand menu of that Address Type page, select the \nStandard Fields \ntab. \nA list of the available Standard Fields associated with Address Type will appear. \n \nClick on the \npencil icon \nnext to the Standard Field that you want to add and configure.\n \nThe Standard Field configuration window will open, allowing you to configure the visibility and validation that you wish to apply for this specific field. \nSee the \nStandard Fields\n page if you require more information about Standard Fields. \nAddress Template\nThe \nAddress Template \nfeature, found as a tab on the left hand menu when opening an Address Type's details, allows users to modify and configure how the Address Type is displayed and what it displays. \nThere are two options to configuring the Address Template: through HTML or through the \nField Picker, \nwhich allows more accessible and easy drag-and-drop functionality for configuration. \nTo toggle from HTML template configuration to the Field Picker, toggle on the \nUse Field Picker \noption at the top of the \nAddress Template \npage.\n \nThe \nField Picker \nfeature will allow you to drag and drop available fields to customize the display that you want to appear for that Address Type.\n \nAdd different variables together in one column; for example, you might want to combine both Address lines together. If you would like labelled captions above each row, toggle on \nInclude Caption\n. When you want to add a new row, click the \n+\n icon located on the right side of the page, underneath the \nSelected Fields\n square.\nClick \nSave \nwhen the Address Template is complete. \nEnabling Multiple Address Types\nEnabling multiple address types will allow multiple addresses for the same organization. To add the multiple addresses, this is configured on the \nCustom Field: Address Type \nfor that organization. This is a useful feature when you would like, for example, to associate one organization with numerous addresses that might respectively correspond to Office, Primary, Alternate, etc. \nTo enable Multiple Address Types, follow these steps: \n1. Click on the 9-square menu icon on the top right of your page.\n \n \n2. Under the heading \nConfiguration, \nselect \nGlobal Settings. \n3. On the first tab, scroll down until the subheading \nSystem Options \nand toggle on the \nEnable Multiple Addresses \nfeature.\n \n4. Press \nSave\n at the bottom of the page.\nOnce you have toggled on this option and saved your change, you have the ability to associate organizations and users to multiple addresses. \nReferencing Address Types\n The @primaryaddress@ and @addressbook@ variables can be used to reference addresses when multiple address types are enabled. See \nAddress Book Template\n for more information.\n Individual Address Type values can be referenced using the \nlist syntax\n [#(?object=address) ... #] under a user or company.\nTroubleshooting Address Types\nThe two key issues that we experience with users needing troubleshooting for Address Types is that they have not enabled \nMultiple Address\n function from the \nGlobal Settings\n page, or they have not made one of the Address Types in their system a \nDefault\n for either Users or Organizations, a function which can be modified directly in that Address Type's page.\nIf you have other problems with Address Types and would like more hands-on support, please feel free to contact our \nSupport Desk\n, which provides 24-5 support for all of our clients.\nSee Also\n \nViewing Address Types\n \nAddress Book Template\n \nImporting Address\n \n Retrieved from ‘\nhttps://wiki.smartsimple.com/index.php?title=Address_Types&oldid=35272\n’ \nCategories\n: \nGlobal Settings\nContacts",
