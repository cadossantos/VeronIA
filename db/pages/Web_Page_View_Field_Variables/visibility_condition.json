  "content": "From SmartWiki\n Jump to: \nnavigation\n, \nsearch\nThis feature uses \nMariaDB\n syntax\n The Visibility Condition section of \nCustom Fields\n, \nUTA Standard Fields\n, \nContact and Account Standard Fields\n and \nSubmit Buttons\n allows you to use logical statements to determine whether or not a field is \nvisible\n. Common visibility condition statements are based on roles, types, statuses, and even field values.\nNote:\n Visibility Conditions take effect when the page is loaded. They will not run dynamically if the condition is based on changing the value of a field that is on the page. If you wish to change the visibility of fields dynamically, you should use the \nShow/Hide Header\n procedure.\nContents\n1\n \nBasic Condition Syntax\n2\n \nMore Examples\n3\n \nMultiple Conditions\n4\n \nNote\n5\n \nSee Also\nBasic Condition Syntax\nVisibility works by determining the truth of a given condition. For example: the field only shows for someone in the Reviewer role. In that case, the condition syntax would look like this:\n@me.inRole(Reviewer)@\nIf the condition is true--that is, the user viewing the page does have the Reviewer role--then the field is displayed.\nThis can also work with a negative: the field is to be hidden from a Reviewer.\n!@me.inRole(Reviewer)@\nNote: because the statement must be true, the above syntax is actually looking to display the field to anyone NOT in the Reviewer role.\nMore Examples\nCondition\nSyntax\nField is only visible if Status is either Draft or Open\n\"@status@\" in ('Draft','Open')\nField is only visible when it contains a value\n\"@fieldname.length@\"*1>0\nField is visible if the type is NOT \"Contract\"\n\"@Type@\"!=\"Contract\"\nField is only visible after February 6, 2015\n\"@date(currentdate)@\">\"2015-02-06\"\nField is only visible if Start Date is on or after May 1, 2009*\n\"@fullstartdate@\" >= \"2009-05-01\"\nField is only visible if the value of Date Initiated is on or after 2014-01-31\n\"@Date Initiated@\" >= \"2014-01-31\"\n \nIMPORTANT:\n for a visibility condition based on the \nstartdate\n or \nenddate\n:\n Use '\n@fullstartdate@'\n rather than '\n@startdate@'\n Use '\n@fullenddate@'\n rather than '\n@enddate@'\n.\n* \nThis will format the stored date as yyyy-mm-dd so it can be compared using < and >.\n\"@fullstartdate@\" >= \"2009-05-01\"\nMultiple Conditions\nIt is also possible to test multiple conditions:\n For an \nOR\n condition use two pipes (|)\n\"@status@\" = \"Closed\" || \"@me.fullname@\"=\"Jane Doe\"\nThe above field will be visible either if the status of the record is \nClosed\n, OR if the user viewing the record is named \nJohn Doe\n.\n For an \nAND\n condition use two ampersands (&)\n\"@status@\" = \"Closed\" && \"@me.fullname@\"=\"John Doe\"\nThe above field will be visible only if the status of the record is \nClosed\n AND the user viewing the record is named \nJohn Doe\n.\n You can also use a combination of these, using brackets to control the order of validation:\n( \"@status@\" = \"Closed\" || \"@status@\" = \"Cancelled\") && (\"@me.fullname@\"=\"John Doe\" || \"@me.fullname@\"=\"John Deer\" || \"@me.fullname@\"=\"Dear John\")\nThe above field will be visible only if the status of the record is either \nClosed\n OR \nCancelled\n, AND the user is one of the 3 named users.\nNote\n It is usually best practice to use double quotes (\") around variables rather than single quotes ('). This is because single quotes are also apostrophes, so if the variable is processed and replaced with a term with an apostrophe it will close the statement and cause a server side error. (In principle the variable could also be replaced with text containing a double quote, also resulting in an error, but double quotes are less commonly stored.)
