This is done in the \nInvoice Item Field Mapping\n section. The fields are:\nItem Detail: \nItem Quantity: \nItem Amount: \nItem Tax: \nItem Tax 2: \nFor example, the associated fields on the Level 2 or Level 3 entities might be named:\nItem Detail:\n@type@\nItem Quantity:\n@quantity@\nItem Amount:\n@rate@\nItem Tax:\n@GST Amount@\nItem Tax 2:\n@PST Amount@\nOn the \nWeb Page View\n you refer to each of these fields using special terminology which allows them to be generated as a list:\nItem Detail: \n~description~\nItem Quantity: \n~qty~\n \nItem Amount: \n~amount~\nItem Tax: \n~tax~\nItem Tax 2: \n~tax2~\nAlso:\n \n~fullamount~\n is used to display the product of Quantity and Amount\n \n~Index\n can be used to number the lines (1, 2, 3...) \n \n~Index~\n start numbering at 1, \n~index~\n starts numbering at 0.\nIf you wish the invoice line items to include fields other than the standard fields (which are Item Detail, Quantity, Amount, Tax and Tax2):\n Create a \nStore Value - System Variables\n field in the \nInvoice Item Custom Fields\n section of the \nInvoice Configuration\n page which refers to the field name of the Level 2 or 3 field (example: @Product Code@). \n Hint: You can use the same name for this field (ie: Create a field called \nProduct Code\n which stores a System Variable called \n@Product Code@\n)\n Within the invoice line item section on the Web Page View you can refer to the field name from the \nInvoice Item Custom Field\n section between $’s. (Example: $Product Code$)\nNOTE: The field name between the $$ is Case Sensitive.\nInvoice Totals\n \n@amount@\n: This is the subtotal, also known as the invoice total before tax (the sum of all ~fullamount~ amounts) \n \n@tax@\n: Total tax 1 on the invoice (the sum of all the ~tax~ amounts) \n \n@tax2@\n: Total tax 2 on the invoice (the sum of all the ~tax2~ amounts) \n \n@invtotal@\n: this is the total amount of the invoice, including both taxes. \n \n@invnumber@\n: this is used to refer to the invoice number if you are using auto-numbering (which can be configured on the \nInvoice Configuration\n page.)\n \n@invdate@\n: display the date of the invoice (by default is the date the invoice is created, but can be changed)\n \n@statusname@\n: display the status of the invoice. (Statuses can be created on the \nInvoice Configuration\n page.)\nExample\nThe following is a example that would be used on the \nWeb Page View\n to create a table listing all the items for the invoice, as well as the Subtotal, Total GST, PST and Invoice Total:\n<table>\n<tr>\n <td>Product Code</td> \n <td>Item Description</td> \n <td>Quantity</td> \n <td>Unit Cost</td>\n <td>Total Cost</td>\n <td>GST</td>\n <td>PST</td>\n</tr>\n<form name=frmsubact>\n[#(?object=items)\n<tr>\n <td>$Product Code$</td> \n <td>~description~</td> \n <td> ~qty~ </td> \n <td> ~amount~ </td>\n <td> ~fullamount~ </td>\n <td> ~tax~ </td>\n <td> ~tax2~ </td>\n</tr>\n#]\n</form>\n<tr> \n <td><b>Sub-Total:</b></td>\n <td>@amount@</td>\n</tr>\n<tr> \n <td><b>Total GST:</b></td>\n <td>@tax@</td>\n</tr>\n<tr> \n <td><b>Total PST:</b></td>\n <td>@tax2@</td>\n</tr>\n<tr> \n <td><b>Total:</b></td>\n <td>@invtotal@</td>\n</tr>\n</table>\nThe code between the \n[#(?object=items)\n and closing \n#]\n will be repeated for each line item to be included on the invoice. \nSee Also\n \nInvoice Configuration Page\n \nTimesheet Variables\n \nWeb Page View Field Variables\n \n Retrieved from ‘\nhttps://wiki.smartsimple.com/index.php?title=Invoice_Module_Variables&oldid=22976\n’ \nCategories\n: \nUniversal Tracking Application\nVariables",
