Click the \nOrganisation\n, \nPeople\n \nmenu\n.\nThe \nPeople\n page is displayed.\nAll contacts are displayed. This includes \ninternal\n and \nexternal\n people. If there are security rules in place such as \nmanager permission\n – view own accounts only, then not all contacts will be displayed.\nThe page is divided into a number of areas:\n \nPeople List\n – this area will display people based on the selection criteria. Initially all contacts are displayed. The columns displayed for each person is controlled by the \nEdit View\n tab – only available to a \nLocal User Administrator\n or \nGlobal User Administrator\n.\n If you have in excess of \n50,000\n contacts in the system we recommend that you suppress the \nAll Contacts\n view and only show the contacts that are selected by the application of a search criteria. You disable this list by using the \nGlobal Settings\n, \nUser & Contact Settings\n, \nDisable Preload People List\n.\n \nSearch Window\n – this area is used to set the criteria for searching.\n \nApply Filter\n – You can save a search as a \nfilter\n and apply without recreating the search.\n \nCheck for Duplicates\n – You can check for duplicates and create new contacts though the \nCheck for Duplicates\n section of the window.\n \nSorting the Contact List\n - You can sort the contact list by clicking on the heading above the column you wish to sort by. Initially, contacts will be displayed in the sequence defined by the \nContact List View\n.\nSearching for Contacts\nWhen you wish to search for contacts you use the \nSearch\n text box.\nContact Type Combo Box\nThe first combo box lists the types of contacts;\n \nEveryone\n – means both \ninternal\n and \nexternal\n contacts.\n \nAll Internal People\n – restricts the searching to just \ninternal\n contacts\n \nAll External People\n – restricts the searching to just \nexternal\n contacts\n \nSelecting a role\n – restricts the search to just contacts in that \nrole\n.\nContact Field Combo Box\nThe second combo box lists the fields that you can search.\nThe contents of this combo box will change based on the type of contact that you select from the first combo box.\n \nEveryone\n – all standard fields for contacts and companies are selectable.\n \nAll Internal People\n – all standard fields for \ninternal\n contacts and companies are selectable plus any \ncustom fields\n that have been added specifically to \ninternal\n people.\n \nAll External People\n – all standard fields for \nexternal\n contacts and companies are selectable plus any \ncustom fields\n that have been added specifically to \nexternal\n people.\n \nSelecting a role\n – all standard fields for contacts and companies are selectable plus any \ncustom fields\n that have been added specifically to the selected \nrole\n.\nSearch Matching Criteria\nYou can set the search so only part of the criteria needs be entered.\n \nExact Word\n – the correct value must be entered. If you were looking for people with the first name “Brendan” then the entire sting – “Brendan” must be entered.\n \nStarts with\n – the start of the criteria is entered and records are retrieved based on that criteria. Entering the string “Bren” would return the records with Brendan as the first name.\n \nEnds with\n – the end of the criteria is entered and records are retrieved based on that criteria. Entering the string “an” would return the records with Brendan as the first name.\n \nContains\n – any part of the criteria is entered and the records are retrieved based on that criteria. Entering the string “rend” would return the records with Brendan as the first name.\nCriteria Text box\nThe actual criteria is entered in the criteria text box.\nSearch within results\nThe \nsearch within results\n check box restricts additional searches to records that met the criteria of the previous search.\nContact Filter\n \nFilters\n are stored search criteria.\n Because the criteria is stored and not the results you can apply the criteria whenever you need to see the current data that matches that criteria.\n In addition, if you have access to the \nEmail Broadcasting\n application you can use the \nfilter\n to select the list of recipients.\n \nFilters\n are stored in the \nuser\n profile and can be deleted if no longer required.\n If you are in a \nrole\n with the \nManager Permission\n, \nCreate Public Filters and Templates\n, then you can permission the \nfilter\n to be used by other people.\nCreating a Contact Filter\nIn this exercise you will create a contact filter and review the \nfilter\n from your \nuser\n settings.\n1. Reapply the criteria that displayed all contacts associated with the organisation beginning with “Human”.\nAll contacts where their organisation begins with the word human are displayed.\nThe Criteria is displayed above the contact list.\n2. Click the \nSave Filter\n button.\nThe Save filter window is displayed.\n3. Set the name to \nPeople in HR\n.\n4. Click the \nSave\n button.\nThe \nfilter\n is saved.\n5. Click the \nApply Filter\n combo box.\nThe filter is displayed.\nRemoving a Filter\nFilters\n are stored in the \nuser’s\n profile and accessed through the Settings \nmenu\n.\n1.
