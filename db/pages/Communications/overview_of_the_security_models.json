You give the \nrole\n access to the resource and everyone with that \nrole\n will have access, regardless of the organisation they are associated with.\n \nOrganisation Based Security\n – access is controlled based on the position of the \nuser\n in the “organisation hierarchy”. You permission the organisation to access the resource, and all \nusers\n in that organisation will have access to the resource.\nYou can use these schemes separately or together to control people’s access to any resource.\nThe \nuser’s\n interface is also controlled by their \nrole\n. Roles are used to control the \nmenu\n items displayed to the \nuser\n, or alternatively, to display a “portal view” to the user overriding the \nadministrative\n interface.\n \n Retrieved from ‘\nhttps://wiki.smartsimple.com/index.php?title=Overview_of_the_Security_Models&oldid=1562\n’ \nCategories\n: \nSystem Management\nRoles\nSecurity",
