  "content": "From SmartWiki\n Jump to: \nnavigation\n, \nsearch\nA typical URL to bring a user to a SmartSimple login page will be in the following format:\nhttp://grants.smartsimplebk.us/s_Login.jsp?lang=1&prole=0\nHowever, if one replaces the \n0\n in the URL's \nprole=0\n suffix with the \nrole ID\n of the role they wish their login session to be constrained to, the user will be logged in and be presented with the portal view associated with that role. This method is referred to as \npassing a parameter\n with the login URL. The role ID specified in the URL is referred to as the \nprimary role\n.\nThis allows for the ability to silo a user into a particular portal view when they possess multiple roles with multiple different portals.\nReturning the primary role with a variable\nUse the following variable syntax to return the roleid associated with the user's primary role: \n@primaryroleid@\nNote: do not use the \n@me.\n syntax, i.e. \n@me.primaryroleid@\n.\nIn the normal course, the \n@primaryroleid@\n variable will return \"0\". If the user has logged in using the method described above, the variable will return the \nrole ID\n of the \"primary role\" used to log in.\nSee Also\n \nrole ID\n \n Retrieved from ‘\nhttps://wiki.smartsimple.com/index.php?title=Primary_role&oldid=18286\n’ \nCategory\n: \nRoles",
