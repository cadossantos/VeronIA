For example, if you are working with “cases” (\nLevel 1 Entity\n), it may be important to have a complete audit trail of all email transactions around the case.\nWhen you review the case you could see all emails both sent and received, plus you can create an email directly within the case.\nTo use this feature you will need to perform the following steps:\n Create a Level 2 item that will function as the transaction type to store the email. Emails can be stored as Level 2 items.\n Generally, you will name the item type “email” and have some statuses within the Level 2 statuses to reflect email items (\nSent\n and \nReceived\n).\n Enable the \nemail\n tab within the \napplication\n so the \nuser\n can click this tab when they wish to send an email.\n Once enabled, you can send an email from within the UTA or from any email address that you click on in the system. When you are not in the UTA and send an email, you are prompted to select the UTA and the Level 1 item that the email should be associated with.\n In order to set this up properly you will need to establish each \nuser’s\n email account setting within your instance of \nSmartSimple\n to ensure that the email is sent from your email server. If you don’t perform this step the email will be sent though the built-in email server within SmartSimple, but as the sender will not match the domain it may be flagged as spam by the recipient’s system.\nIn the following exercise, you will use the original \nContract Tracker\n \napplication\n:\nFirst you will create the Level 2 type to store the email messages.\n1. Choose \nApplications\n, \nContract Tracker\n \nmenu\n.\n2. Click the \nSettings\n tab.\n3. Scroll to the \nActivity Setting\n and click the \nTypes\n link.\n4. Click the \nNew\n tab.\n5. Create the following type:\n6. Click the \nSave\n button.\nCreating an Email Status\nThough you could use an existing status for email such as new, it is better to create a specific status.\n1. Click the \nSettings\n tab.\n2. Scroll to the \nActivity Settings\n and click the \nStatuses\n link.\n3. Click the \nNew\n tab.\n4. Create the following status:\n5. Click the \nSave\n button.\nLinking the Email Type and Status to the UTA\nNow you can configure the application to indicate that all email will be of the Level 2 type: Email with the status Email on File.\n1. Click the \nSettings\n tab.\n2. Scroll to the \nContract Settings\n section.\n3. Disable the \nHide Email Tab\n check box.\nThis will enable the display of the email tab in each Level 1 item.\n4. Scroll to the \nEmail Activity\n section of the page.\nThis section is used to define the relationship between an email message and a Level 2 type and status.\n Default \nActivity Type\n is set to the Level 2 type that you wish to use to store the email message.\n Default \nActivity Status\n is set to the Level 2 status that you wish to set the item status.\n Display \nContracts with the Selected Status\n is used to restrict the Level 1 items displayed when you are sending the email from some other area of \nSmartSimple\n. For example, if there are thousands of cases you may not want to show the cases with a closed status.\n5. Configure these settings as shown below:\n6. Click any \nSave\n button.\nThese settings indicate that all emails sent or received will be of the type “email” with the status “Email on File” and that when you send an email from some other part of SmartSimple, only Level 1 items with the status \nNegotiation\n or \nUnder Review\n will be displayed.\nSpecifying which Level 1 Template can send Email\nBefore you can use the new email you need to indicate which Level 1 \ntemplates\n are “allowed’ to send email messages.\n1. Scroll to the \nContract Settings\n section.\n2. Click the \nTemplates\n link.\n3. Click on the first template – \nNon-Disclosure Agreement\n.\nThe supported Level 2 types are displayed at the bottom right of the page.\n4. Click the \nEmail\n check box.\n5. Click the \nSave\n button.\n6. Repeat this process for each \ntemplate\n.\nSending an Email Message\n1. Click the \nContracts\n tab.\n2. Click into either of the contracts that you previously created.\nThe contract record is displayed.\nThe \nNew Email\n tab is displayed at the top of the contract window.\n3. Click the \nNew Email\n tab.\nThe Email Message Centre is displayed.\n4. Click the \nCompose\n button.\nThe email window is displayed.\n5. Click the \nTo…\n button and select a contact.\n6. Set the \nSubject\n and \nBody\n to some sample text.\n7. Click the \nSend\n button.\nThe email is sent and the Level 2 item created from the email.\n8. Review the Level 2 activities at the bottom on the Level 1 item.\nThe email has been added to the activity list.\n9. Click into the \nItem\n.\nThe email is displayed.\nThe original email can be displayed through the \nView Email\n tab.\n10. Click the \nView Email\n tab.\nThe original message is displayed and can be forwarded or replied.\n11. Close the \nView Email\n window.\nConfiguring Level 3 Types as Emails\n In some cases, you may want to configure SmartSimple to treat emails as Level 3 objects. \n The benefit of this configuration is that users will be able to send email messages directly from a Level 2 record.\n The configuration steps will be the same as laid out above, replacing references to Level 1 with Level 2 and Level 2 with Level 3.\n In all cases, emails will be displayed in a tab layout under the related Level 1 record. \n \nSecurity Matrix and the Shadow Applications\n \nExporting Companies and Contacts\n \n \n Retrieved from ‘\nhttps://wiki.smartsimple.com/index.php?title=Integrating_Email_with_the_UTA&oldid=19913\n’ \nCategories\n: \nUniversal Tracking Application\nEmail",
