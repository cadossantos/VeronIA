This application can be used in a variety of ways: \n Newsletters and updates for customers, \ninternal\n staff and \nexternal\n applicants\n Invitations to events and links to public calendars\n Links to surveys or contests to be completed by customers\nThe \nEmail Broadcast\n function in SmartSimple is a handy way to send mass messages to the recipients that you choose to receive a message. It is useful for large batches of recipients, acting more like a broadcast than a direct reply-to communication \nemail\n. \n \nTip: \nIf you use the email broadcast feature regularly for your SmartSimple \ninstance\n, you can create a \nshortcut\n on your home page for quicker access to this function.\nConfiguration - Essentials\nGeneral Characteristics of Email Broadcast\nTo create an \nemail broadcast\n you will need access to the \nEmail Broadcast\n \napplication\n. Unlike most other \napplications\n, there are no manager permissions associated with this \napplication\n. Once you enable the \napplication\n, you can use all the features.\nEach \nemail broadcast\n consists of two components:\n A message formatted in HTML or plain text containing links to other sites, pages or \nSmartSimple\n features; such as web forms and calendars.
